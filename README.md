# Pong-Game
the old pong game programmed in ARM assembly and C. The board is a LandTiger v2.0 . I used the RIT, button ( INT1, INT2, INT0, RESET ), and Adjustable potentiometer VR1. the game is against a simple A.I. 
Every start new game the user is asked
to choose the difficulty, again using the 3 buttons. Once selected, the pad above will move
with a certain speed and intelligence depending on the difficulty.
After each point, to resume the game you must press key1
